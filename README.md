# Tapod Extension

Tapod is a lightweight browser extension that gives your new tab a minimal look. Every time you open a new tab, Tapod displays NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), so you get a stunning space photo and a bit of info, right from your browser.

It's built with Svelte and WXT.
